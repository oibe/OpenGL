Incomplete parts:

  -[none]

Bugs in code:
-------------
  -[none]

Extensions/extra credit completed:
----------------------------------
  - [ I have implemented the torus with all proper features such as drawing normals, toonshading, etc.]
  - [ I have called glPolygon offset to change the depth of the polygons so that the wireframe does not have a "flickery" appearance.]
  - [ I have implemented the phong model see comments in illum.fp the section is labeled "PHONG MODEL COMMENTS"]
  - [ I implemented a parametrization known as a dini surface and got everything to work for it. Just type "-dini" in the command line arguments and it should come up.] 
  - [ I drew all the normals for models and parametrized shapes.]
